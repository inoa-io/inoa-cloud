  title: Hawkbit Management API
  description: |
    The Management API is a RESTful API that enables to perform Create/Read/Update/Delete operations for provisioning targets (i.e. devices) and repository content (i.e. software).
    Based on the Management API you can manage and monitor software update operations via HTTP/HTTPS. The Management API supports JSON payload with hypermedia as well as filtering, sorting and paging. Furthermore the Management API provides permission based access control and standard roles as well as custom role creation.
