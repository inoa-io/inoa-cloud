Inoa is a lightweight IoT integration platform that
will help you to easily start with your IoT project and offer you the needed infrastructure to develop, deploy, maintain
and scale your solutions. With Inoa we want to enable users to stay in control of their IoT gateways and measured and/or
controlled devices.
