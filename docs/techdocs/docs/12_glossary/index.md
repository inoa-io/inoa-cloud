# Glossary

??? tip

    **Contents**

    The most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use
    when discussing the system.

    You can also see the glossary as source for translations if you work in
    multi-language teams.

    **Motivation**

    You should clearly define your terms, so that all stakeholders

    - have an identical understanding of these terms
    - do not use synonyms and homonyms

    **Form**

    - A table with columns <Term\> and <Definition\>.
    - Potentially more columns in case you need translations.

    See [Glossary](https://docs.arc42.org/section-12/) in the arc42
    documentation.
