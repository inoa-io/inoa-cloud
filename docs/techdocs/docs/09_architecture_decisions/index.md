## Add a new Decision

1. Figure out the number of your ADR by incrementing the last one. (Verify also open merge requests!)

3. Create a new markdown file inside this folder with the naming schema `ADR<###>-short-topic-in-lower-letters.md`
4. Write the ADR with status `PROPOSAL`
5. Create a merge request and add reviewers
6. After discussion and alignment, merge the ADR with status `DECIDED` into main.
