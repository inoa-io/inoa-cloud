# ADR001: Record architecture decisions

- Status: {==__DECIDED__==}
- Date: __2024-10-18__

## Context

We need to make decisions for `INOA` in different contexts.
To make these decisions transparent, we need some tooling for it, that enables us with an easy-to-use process to make
decisions together.

## Decision

1. We record architecture decisions within this project.
2. We use __Pull Requests__ to make decisions transparent to the team and give everybody the chance to add his
   preferences.

## Consequences

1. Our decisions become transparent to all developers and users of `INOA`.
2. Every team member must understand [MarkDown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) syntax.
