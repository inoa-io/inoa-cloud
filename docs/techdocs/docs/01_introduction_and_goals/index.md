??? tip

    **Contents**

    The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose
    fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. We
    really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with

    **Motivation**

    You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders,
    since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. Make sure
    to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords. If you as an
    architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...
